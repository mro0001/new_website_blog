      "contents": "\nCV and Bio\nCV August 15th, 2021\nI am currently an Assistant Professor of Public Administration at the University of Idaho where I research local government management, data science, budgeting, and economic development. I graduated with my Ph.D. from the University of North Texas in 2015. Unlike many of my comteporaries, I did not go directly into academia. Instead, I worked at the North Central Texas Council of Governments as a Transportation Planner then as the Grant Manager at the John Peter Smith Foundation. This experience was invaluable in shaping my understanding of local governance and changing the way I approach research.\nMy research into local governments is eclectic–much like my professional history–and explores data science, budgeting and economic development. More specifically, I study competition among local governments, economic development and municipal fiscal health, and data science in the public sector. My research has been published in Public Administration Review, the American Review of Public Administration, State and Local Government Review, the International Journal of Public Administration, Municipal Finance Journal, and Teaching Public Administration.\nWhile I teach a variety of courses, I primarily teach courses in Local Government Management and Public Budgeting and Finance. I enjoy finding unique ways to introduce students to public administration. For example, I developed and taught an introductory PA course for undergraduates that required no textbook and instead assigned episodes of Parks and Recreation. My strongest pedagoical contribution has been in the area of data science where I have taught multiple courses for MPA students and even designed a graduate level data science certificate for those without math or programming backgrounds.\nMy career has been a wild ride of practice, scholarship, and education and much to the chagrin of my introversion, I have received the following awards and honors:\n2021 Benjamin and Patricia Doty Award, University of Idaho\n2017 ASPA Founders Fellow, American Society of Public Administration\n2016 Leadership Acceleration Program, John Peter Smith Health Network\n2016 Lincoln Scholars Program, Lincoln Institute of Land Policy\n2015 Toulouse Dissertation Award in Social Science, University of North Texas\nI am proud to serve the public sector in my roll as a professor. It is a gift to have the flexibility to research, teach, and collaborate with local governments to serve the public.\nIf you care to read more about me, you can find a more in-depth profile here\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nGrants\nAs a tenure track professor, I have generated over $600,000 in external grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Smart Transit, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and the North Central Texas Council of Governments. Before beginning my academic career, I was a grant manager for the John Peter Smith Foundation–the non-profit arm of the Tarrant County, TX hospital network where I learned how to write and manage local, state, federal, and non-profit grants that had nothing to do with research. I have some strong opinions about grant writing as an academic and as a professional in the public sector. Hopefully, my experience can help others on their grant journey.\nConsulting\nMy grant writing experience and success can be useful for non-profits and governments looking for help developing and reviewing proposals, but more importantly, creating a grant strategy that leverages an organizations strengths while being mindful of the funding environment. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about my grant consulting services\n\n\n\n",

While it is difficult sometimes to say goodbye to a pup you only recently adopted, old Shih Tzus are perfect pets. They are small, lazy, (mostly) sweet, and like to cuddle all the time.\nBesides our pack we enjoy nerdy board games including Dungeons and Dragons (are you really surprised), kayaking, and consuming an absurd amount of TV. If you ever want to dish about a show on Bravo, I am here for it.\nOn a more serious note, I am an adult and academic with ADHD. Since I was diagnosed after receiving my PhD, I am constantly discovering what it means to have ADHD and how it affects my family, friends, students, co-workers and collaborators. I strongly believe that my ADHD has been both a gift and something that presents very real barriers to a successful professional life.\nMeet the furry Rovertons!\nDixonSkittlesHazelnutZiggyDice Passed Away\n\n\n\n",
